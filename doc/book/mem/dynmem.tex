\chapter{dynmem}

Dynmem is a memory block allocator that always allocates memory in
$1 \:\textrm{MB}$ blocks. See fig. \ref{figure:dynmem_blocks}.
Dynmem allocates its blocks as $1 \:\textrm{MB}$ sections from the L1 kernel
master page table and always returns physically contiguous memory regions. If
dynmem is passed for a thread it can be mapped either as a section entry or
via L2 page table, though this is normally not done as the vm interface is
used instead, though this is normally not done as the vm interface is
