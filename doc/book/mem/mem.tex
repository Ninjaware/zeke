\chapter{An Overview to Memory Management in Zeke}

This chapter briefly introduces the architectural layout of memory management
in Zeke at very generic level. Specifically we do not cover memory map layout or
anything hardware specific.

Zeke as well as most of major operating systems divides its memory management
and mapping to several layers. In Zeke these layers are \ac{MMU} abstraction,
\verb+dynmem+ handling dynamic allocation of contiguous blocks of memory and
\verb+kmalloc+ that allocates memory for the kernel itself, and probably most
importantly \verb+vralloc/buf/bio+ system that's handling all allocations for
processes and IO buffers.

Figure \ref{figure:mm_layers} shows the memory management stacking from kmalloc's
perspective.

\begin{description}
\item[kmalloc] is a malloc-like interface for allocating arbitrary sized blocks
  of memory.
\item[dynmem] is a block allocator that always allocates memory in block size of
  $1 \:\textrm{MB}$. See fig. \ref{figure:dynmem_blocks}.
\end{description}

kmalloc stores its linked list of reserved and free blocks in the same memory
that is used to allocate memory for its clients. Listing \ref{list:mblockt}
shows the \verb+mblock_t+ structure definition used internally in kmalloc for
linking blocks of memory.
