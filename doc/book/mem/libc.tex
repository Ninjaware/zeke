\chapter{Libc: Memory Management}

Zeke libc supports the standard memory management features provided by
most of Unices. The syscalls that can be used for memory allocation are
\verb+brk()+/\verb+sbrk()+ and \verb+mmap()+/\verb+munmap()+, and the
standard malloc interface is internally using these facilities to allocate
and free memory.
