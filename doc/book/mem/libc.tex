\chapter{Libc: Memory Management}

Zeke libc provides memory management features equal to most of the modern Unices
available. The syscalls that can be used for memory allocation are
\verb+brk()+/\verb+sbrk()+ and \verb+mmap()+/\verb+munmap()+.  The standard
malloc interface provided by the libc is internally using these facilities to
manage its memory chunks.
