\chapter{\acf{rcu}}

\acf{rcu} is a low overhead synchronization method mainly used for
synchronization between multiple readers and rarely occuring writers. The
\ac{rcu} implementation in the Zeke kernel is not strictly time-based but a
kind-of state machine that rougly swaps states when reclaiming resources is
possible.
