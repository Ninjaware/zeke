\chapter{Executable File Formats}

\section{Introduction to executables in Zeke}

The kernel has a support for implementing loader functions for any new
executable format but currently only 32bit \acf{elf} support exist.
Loading of a new process image is invoked by calling exec syscall call that
calls \verb+load_image()+ function in \verb+kern/exec.c+ file.
Process image loaders are advertised by using \verb+EXEC_LOADER+ macro.

\section{ELF32}

The \acs{elf} loader in Zeke can be used to load statically linked executables
as well as anything linked dynamically. Currently only two loadable sections can
be loaded, code region and heap region.

\subsection{Suported \acs{elf} sections}
\subsubsection{Load sections}

The kernel reads process memory regions based on information provided by
\verb+PT_LOAD+ sections in the \acs{elf} file.

\subsubsection{Note sections}

The kernel can read additional information needed for exec from note sections,
currently supported note types are \verb+NT_VERSION+ and \verb+NT_STACKSIZE+.
\verb+NT_STACKIZE+ note can be used to tell the kernel the preferred minimum
size for the main thread stack. The note required for indicating the minimum
stack size can be created with \verb+ELFNOTE_STACKSIZE+ macro provided by
\verb+sys/elf_notes.h+ header file, see listing \ref{list:hugestack}.
