\chapter{Processes and Threads}

The process and thread management in Zeke is based on an idea that a
process is a container for threads owned by the process and it manages the
memory space and resources used by its threads. Naturally this means that a
process must always own at least one thread, that is the main thread and all
other threads are children of the main thread. While a process is an unit
or a context of resource allocation, a thread is an object describing the
execution state, in other words a unit of execution, of an user space
application. Any process not having a main thread is immediately removed
from the system because there is nothing to execute.

Since a process is a container containing the main thread, and other threads,
there is no global execution state for a process, like in some other operating
systems. Some operating systems may use the main thread status as the process
state but Zeke makes an isolation between the process state and the thread
state. Thus a currently running process is mostlikely in \verb+READY+ state
for most of the time.

\subsection{The thread management concept}

  \label{figure:thtree}
\end{figure}

The following notation is used:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb+tid_X+ = Thread ID
  \item \verb+pid_a+ = Process ID
  \item \verb+0+ = NULL
\end{itemize}

\verb+process_a+ a has a main thread called \verb+main+. Thread
\verb+main+ has two child thread called \verb+child_1+ and \verb+child_2+.
\verb+child_2+ has created one child thread called \verb+child_2_1+.

\verb+main+ owns all the threads it has created and at the same time child
threads may own their own threads. If parent thread is killed then the
children of the parent are killed first in somewhat reverse order.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb+parent+ = Parent thread of the current thread if any
  \item \verb+first_child+ = First child created by the current thread
  \item \verb+next_child+ = Next child in chain of children created by the
        parent thread
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Examples}

\subparagraph*{process\_a is killed}

Before \verb+process_a+ can be killed \verb+main+ thread must be killed,
because it has child threads its children has to be resolved and killed in
reverse order of creation.

\subparagraph*{child\_2 is killed}

Killing of \verb+child_2+ causes \verb+child_2_1+ to be killed first.

% TODO sections
Figure \ref{figure:procstates} shows all state transitions
of a process in Zeke.

Calling \verb+fork+ syscall causes a creation of a new process container,
cloning of the currently executing thread as a new main thread as well as
marking all current memory regions as copy-on-write regions for both processes.
Marking all currently mapped regions as COW makes it easy to get rid of
otherwise hard to solve race conditions.

When a process calls \verb+exec+ syscall the current main thread is replaced by
a newly created main thread that's pointing to the new process image, ie.
\acs{PC} is set to the entry point of the new image. Before \verb+exec+
transfers control to the new program the kernel will run resource cleanups and
inherit properties as mandated by the \acs{POSIX} standard.
