\section{\acs{elf} support}\label{sec:libc_elf}

Zeke libc supports adding simple note sections to \acs{elf} files by using
macros provided by \verb+sys/elf_notes.h+ header file. As discussed
previously in chapter \ref{chap:exec}, some additional information about the
runtime environment requirements can be passed via note sections. For example,
a macro called \verb+ELFNOTE_STACKSIZE+ can be used for indicating the minimum
stack size needed by the main tread of an executable, see listing
\ref{list:hugestack}.

\subsection{Creating a daemon}

Creating a daemon is probably one of the main features of operating systems
like Zeke. The preferred way of creating a daemon in Zeke is forking once and
creating a new session for the child process by calling \verb+setsid()+. The
parent process may exit immediately after forking. Listing \ref{list:daemon}
shows an example of a daemon creation procedure.
