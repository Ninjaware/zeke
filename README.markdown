Zero Kernel is a tiny kernel implementation that was originally targeted for
ARM Corex-M microcontrollers. The reason to start this project was that most of
currently (or back then) available RTOSes for M0 were bit bloat and secondly I
found architectures based on ARMv6-M to be quite challenging and interesting
platforms for RTOS/kernel development, especially when ARMv6-M is compared to
ARMv7-M used in M4 core or any Cortex-A cores using real ARM architectures.

One of the original goals of Zero Kernel was to make it CMSIS-RTOS compliant
where possible, as some concepts of Zeke were not actually CMSIS compliant from
the begining. However the scope of the project shifted pretty early and the
kernel is no longer CMSIS compatible at any level. Currently Zeke is no moving
towards POSIX-like system and its user space is taking a very Unix-like shape.
Nowadays Zeke is a bit bloatty when compared to the original standard of
a bloated OS but I claim Zeke is still quite tightly integrated system,
compared to any other Unix-like OS implementation.

Compiling and Testing
---------------------

### Prerequisites

To successfully compile Zeke, you'll need the following packages/tools:

- `make` >3.8
- `llvm` 3.3 or 3.4
- `clang` 3.3 or 3.4
- `binutils`
-- arm-none-eabi
-- mipsel-sde-elf
- `bash`
- `mkdosfs` and `mtools` for creating a rootfs image
- `cloc` for source code stats
- `ncurses-devel`

doc-book target:

- LaTeX + various packages
- latexmk
- gnuplot

Doxygen targets:

- Doxygen
- man for viewing man pages

### Compiling

+ `configure`- Set defaults for files in config dir
+ `make all rootfs` - Compile the kernel, user space and create a rootfs image
+ `make kernel.img` - Compile the kernel
+ `make world` - Compile only the user space without creating a rootfs image
+ `make opttest` - Compile on target tests
+ `make clean` - Clean all compilation targets

Run `make help` for full list of targets and compilation flags.

### Running Zeke in QEMU

Qemu from rpi branch of `git@github.com:Torlus/qemu.git` repository seems to work
best for BCM2835/Raspberry Pi version of Zeke.

    ../src/configure --prefix=[PATH TO BIN] --target-list=arm-softmmu,arm-linux-user,armeb-linux-user --enable-sdl
    make -j4 && sudo make install

### Running Zeke on real ARM

Zeke should boot just fine with, practically, any bootloader that is capable of
loading a linux image. However Zeke only supports ATAGs for gathering device
information so some older bootloader may work better. Though ATAGs are optional
so basically any bootloader should work if you compile Zeke without configATAG.
