    The FatFs driver will permit the kernel to read and write MS-DOS based
    file systems. This driver covers the FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 file system
    versions.

    Some hardware platforms like raspberry may require a FAT boot partition,
    so this driver is useful for accessing that partiotion too.

    ---help---
        Since DOS 7.0 the offsets 0x12 and 0x13 have been used for saving the
        last access time (known as atime in Unix-like systems). However, atime
        is not a very popular file system feature these days and even DOS had it
        disabled by default (ACCDATE in CONFIG.SYS enabled it).

        FlexOS, 4680 OS, 4690 OS, DR-DOS and some other multi-user operating
        systems used these bytes for storing owner IDs.

        Zeke offers a choice between atime or storing UID and GID in these
        bytes.
